## Basic Information

Okta, Inc. is an **identity and access management company** that provides cloud software to help companies **manage and secure user authentication into modern applications**, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, website web services and devices.

Their core service, called the Okta Identity Cloud, offers products that include single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), lifecycle management, universal directory, API access management, and more. This helps companies to both protect their sensitive data and also streamline user access, making applications and services more accessible and easy to use for employees or customers.

Okta's services are widely used in enterprise contexts, as well as by smaller companies and developers. It plays a crucial role in enabling businesses to securely adopt and manage cloud technologies. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Okta remains a significant player in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) industry.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The main gola of Okta is to configure access to different users and groups to external applications. If you manage to **compromise administrator privileges in an Oktas** environment, you will highly probably able to **compromise all the other platforms the company is using**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To perform a security review of an Okta environment you should ask for **administrator read-only access**.
{% endhint %}

## Directory

### People

From an attackers perspective, this is super interesting as you will be able to see **all the users registered**, their **email** addresses, the **groups** they are part of, **profiles** and even **devices** (mobiles along with their OSs).

For a whitebox review check that there aren't several "Pending user action" and "Password reset"

### Groups

This is where you find all the created groups in Okta. it's interesting to understand the different groups (set of **permissions**) that could be granted to **users**.\
It's possible to see the **people included inside groups** and **apps assigned** to each goup.

Ofc, any group with the name of **admin** is interesting, specially the group **Global Administrators,** check the members to learn who are the most privileged members.

From a whitebox review, there **shouldn't be more than 5 global admins** (better if there are only 2 or 3).

### Devices

Find here a **list of all the devices** of all the users. You can also see if it's being **actively managed** or not.

### Profile Editor

Here is possible to observe how key information such as first names, last names, emails, usernames... are shared between Okta and other applications. This is interesting because if a user can **modify in Okta a field** (such as his name or email) that then is used by an **external application** to **identify** the user, an insider could try to **take over other accounts**.

Moreover, in the profile **`User (default)`** from Okta you can see **which fields** each **user** has and which ones are **writable** by users. If you cannot see the admin panel, just go to **update your profile** information and you will see which fields you can update (note that to update an email address you will need to verify it).

### Directory Integrations

Directories allow you to import people from existing sources. I guess here you will see the users imported from other directories.

I haven't seen it, but I guess this is interesting to find out **other directories that Okta is using to import users** so if you **compromise that directory** you could set some attributes values in the users created in Okta and **maybe compromise the Okta env**.

### Profile Sources

A profile source is an **application that acts as a source of truth** for user profile attributes. A user can only be sourced by a single application or directory at a time.

I haven't seen it, so any information about security and hacking regarding this option is appreciated.
