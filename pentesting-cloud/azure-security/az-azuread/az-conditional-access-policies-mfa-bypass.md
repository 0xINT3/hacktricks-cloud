## Basic Information

Azure Conditional Access policies are rules set up in Microsoft Azure to enforce access controls to Azure services and applications based on certain **conditions**. These policies help organizations secure their resources by applying the right access controls under the right circumstances.\
Conditional access policies basically **defines** **Who** can access **What** from **Where** and **How**.

Here are a couple of examples:

1. **Sign-In Risk Policy**: This policy could be set to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) when a sign-in risk is detected. For example, if a user's login behavior is unusual compared to their regular pattern, such as logging in from a different country, the system can prompt for additional authentication.
2. **Device Compliance Policy**: This policy can restrict access to Azure services only to devices that are compliant with the organization's security standards. For instance, access could be allowed only from devices that have up-to-date antivirus software or are running a certain operating system version.

## Conditional Acces Policies Bypasses

It's possible that a conditional access policy is **checking some information that can be easily tampered allowing a bypass of the policy**. And if for example the policy was configuring MFA, the attacker will be able to bypass it.

### Device Platforms - Device Condition

It's possible to set a condition based on the **device platform** (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS), however, this is based on the **user-agent** so it's pretty easy to bypass. Even **making all the options enforce MFA**, if you use a **user-agent that it doesn't recognize** you will be able to bypass the mFA.

### Locations: Countries, IP ranges - Device Condition

Of course if this is set in the conditional policy, an attacker could just use a **VPN** in the **allowed country** or try to find a way to access from an **allowed IP address** to bypass these conditions.

### Office365 Client Apps

You could indicate that if clients **access Office 365 apps from the browser they need MFA**:

To bypass this, it's possible to pretend you log-in into an app from a desktop application (like to Microsoft Teams in the following example) which will bypass the protection:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (130).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As Microsoft Teams app has a lot of permissions, you will be able to use that access.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can find the I**D of more public applications** with predefined Office365 permissions in the database of roadtools:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sql
SELECT appId, displayName FROM ApplicationRefs WHERE publicCLient = 1 ORDER BY displayName ASC
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}

This attack is specially interesting because by default public Office365 applications will have permissions to access some data.

### Other apps

By default, other apps created by users won't have permissions and could be private.\
However, users could also create **public** **apps** granting them some **permissions.**

A potential scenario where a policy is set to **require MFA to access an application** when the user is using a **browser** (maybe because it's a web application and therefore it will be the only way), if there is a **proxy application** -an application allowed to **interact to other apps on behalf of users**-, the user could **login in the proxy application** and then through this proxy application **login into the initially MFA protected app**.

## Other Az MFA Bypasses

### Ring tone

One Azure MFA option is to **receive a call in the configured phone number** where it will be asked the user to **send the char `#`**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
As chars are just **tones**, an attacker could **compromise** the **voicemail** message of the phone number, configure as the message the **tone of `#`** and then, when requesting the MFA make sure that the **victims phone is busy** (calling it) so the Azure call gets redirected to the voice mail.
{% endhint %}

### Compliant Devices

Policies often asks for a compliant device or MFA, so an **attacker could register a compliant device**, get a **PRT** token and **bypass this way the MFA**.

Start by registering a **compliant device in Intune**, then **get the PRT** with:

[pass-the-prt.md](../az-lateral-movement-cloud-on-prem/pass-the-prt.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Tooling

### Invoke-MFASweep

MFASweep is a PowerShell script that attempts to **log in to various Microsoft services using a provided set of credentials and will attempt to identify if MFA is enabled**. Depending on how conditional access policies and other multi-factor authentication settings are configured some protocols may end up being left single factor. It also has an additional check for ADFS configurations and can attempt to log in to the on-prem ADFS server if detected.

```bash
Invoke-MFASweep -Username <username> -Password <pass>
```

```bash
