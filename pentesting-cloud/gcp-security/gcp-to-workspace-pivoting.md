## **Understanding Domain-Wide Delegation**

Google Workspace's Domain-Wide delegation allows an identity object, either an **external app** from Google Workspace Marketplace or an internal **GCP Service Account**, to **access data across the Workspace on behalf of users**. This feature, which is crucial for apps interacting with Google APIs or services needing user impersonation, enhances efficiency and minimizes human error by automating tasks. Using OAuth 2.0, app developers and administrators can give these service accounts access to user data without individual user consent.\
\
Google Workspace allows the creation of two main types of global delegated object identities:

* **GWS Applications:** Applications from the Workspace Marketplace can be set up as a delegated identity. Before being made available in the marketplace, each Workspace application undergoes a review by Google to minimize potential misuse. While this does not entirely eliminate the risk of abuse, it significantly increases the difficulty for such incidents to occur.
* **GCP Service Account:** Learn more about [**GCP Service Accounts here**](gcp-basic-information.md#service-accounts).

### **Domain-Wide Delegation: Under the Hood**

This is how a GCP Service Account can access Google APIs on behalf of other identities in Google Workspace:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. &#x20;**Identity creates a JWT:**  The Identity uses the service account's private key (part of the JSON key pair file) to sign a JWT. This JWT contains claims about the service account, the target user to impersonate, and the OAuth scopes of access to the REST API which is being requested.
2. &#x20;**The Identity uses the JWT to request an access token:** The application/user uses the JWT to request an access token from Google's OAuth 2.0 service. The request also includes the target user to impersonate (the user's Workspace email), and the scopes for which access is requested.
3. **Google's OAuth 2.0 service returns an access token:** The access token represents the service account's authority to act on behalf of the user for the specified scopes. This token is typically short-lived and must be refreshed periodically (per the application's need).  It's essential to understand that the OAuth scopes specified in the JWT token have validity and impact on the resultant access token. For instance, access tokens possessing multiple scopes will hold validity for numerous REST API applications.
4. **The Identity uses the access token to call Google APIs**: Now with a relevant access token, the service can access the required REST API. The application uses this access token in the "Authorization" header of its HTTP requests destined for Google APIs. These APIs utilize the token to verify the impersonated identity and confirm it has the necessary authorization.&#x20;
5. **Google APIs return the requested data**: If the access token is valid and the service account has appropriate authorization, the Google APIs return the requested data. For example, in the following picture, we‚Äôve leveraged the _users.messages.list_ method to list all the Gmail message IDs associated with a target Workspace user.&#x20;

## New delegation with interactive GWS access

In the first scenario, an actor typically gains initial access to an IAM identity, with the ability to **create service accounts in a GCP project.** In addition, he now holds a **super admin privilege to GWS.**

**Attack steps:**

1. **Generating a New Service Account and Corresponding Key Pair:** On GCP, new service account resources can be produced either interactively via the console or programmatically using direct API calls and CLI tools. This requires the **role `iam.serviceAccountAdmin`** or any custom role equipped with the **`iam.serviceAccounts.create`** **permission**. Once the service account is created, we'll proceed to generate a **related key pair** (**`iam.serviceAccountKeys.create`** permission).
2.  **Creation of new delegation**: After having a relevant identity object and a related private key that enables authentication with Google APIs, we need to **establish a new delegation rule for the service account resource within Google Workspace**. This delegation rule will enable us to perform the Google APIs activity on Workspace REST API applications. It's important to understand that **only the Super Admin role possesses the capability to set up global Domain-Wide delegation in Google Workspace** and Domain-Wide delegation **cannot be set up programmatically,** It can only be created and adjusted **manually** through the Google Workspace **console**.

    The creation of the rule can be found under the page **API controls ‚Üí Manage Domain-Wide delegation in Google Workspace Admin console**.
3. **Attaching OAuth scopes privilege**: When configuring a new delegation, Google requires only 2 parameters, the Client ID, which is the **OAuth ID of the GCP Service Account** resource, and **OAuth scopes** that define what API calls the delegation requires.\
   The **full list of OAuth scopes** can be found [**here**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes).
4. **Acting on behalf of the target identity:** At this point, we have a functioning delegated object in GWS. Now, **using the GCP Service Account private key, we can perform API calls** (in the scope defined in the OAuth scope parameter) to trigger it and **act on behalf of any identity that exists in Google Workspace**. As we learned, the service account will generate access tokens per its needs and according to the permission he has to REST API applications.

### Cross-Organizational delegation

OAuth SA ID is global and can be used for **cross-organizational delegation**. There has been no restriction implemented to prevent cross-global delegation. In simple terms, **service accounts from different GCP organizations can be used to configure domain-wide delegation on other Workspace organizations**. This would result in **only needing Super Admin access to Workspace**, and not access to the same GCP account, as the adversary can create Service Accounts and private keys on his personally controlled GCP account.

## Compromise existing delegation - DeleFriend

In case we have access to a relevant GCP service account resource with **existing Domain-Wide delegation** within the IAM Policy, nothing stops us from creating a new key, enumerating all the existing JWT possibilities and using that existing delegation to perform API calls to Google Workspace on behalf of other identities in the domain.

{% hint style="danger" %}
After compromising somehow a GCP organization/project, an attacker could check to which GCP Service Accounts he can create **json keys**, create them and check if the **SA has access on behalf of other identities to some Workspace OAuth scopes**.
{% endhint %}

These are the exact steps:

1. **Enumerate GCP Projects** using Resource Manager API.
2. Iterate on each project resource, and **enumerate GCP Service account resources** to which the initial IAM user has access using _GetIAMPolicy_.
3. Iterate on **each service account role**, and find built-in, basic, and custom roles with _**serviceAccountKeys.create**_ permission on the target service account resource. It should be noted that the Editor role inherently possesses this permission.
4. Create a **new **_**KEY\_ALG\_RSA\_2048**_** private key to each service account** resource which is found with relevant permission in the IAM policy.
5. Iterate on **each new service account and create a **_**JWT**_** object** for it which is composed of the SA private key credentials and an OAuth scope. The process of creating a new _JWT_ object will **iterate on all the existing combinations of OAuth scopes** from **oauth\_scopes.txt** list, in order to find all the delegation possibilities. The list **oauth\_scopes.txt** is updated with all of the OAuth scopes we‚Äôve found to be relevant for abusing Workspace identities.
6. The _\_make\_authorization\_grant\_assertion_ method reveals the necessity to declare a t**arget workspace user**, referred to as _subject_, for generating JWTs under DWD. While this may seem to require a specific user, it's important to realize that **DWD influences every identity within a domain**. Consequently, creating a JWT for **any domain user** affects all identities in that domain, consistent with our combination enumeration check. Simply put, one valid Workspace user is adequate to move forward.\
   This user can be defined in DeleFriend‚Äôs _config.yaml_ file. If a target workspace user is not already known, the tool facilitates the automatic identification of valid workspace users by scanning domain users with roles on GCP projects. It's key to note (again) that JWTs are domain-specific and not generated for every user; hence, the automatic process targets a single unique identity per domain.
7. **Enumerate and create a new bearer access token** for each JWT and validate the token against tokeninfo API.
